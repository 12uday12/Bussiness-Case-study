Recommendations:
As it is seen in 2018 growth of sales have been massive but during some months it was not so we can look to offer discounts during those
months

We can look for setting up stores at places  from which orders have been comparatively low so that fright value can be 
low and products can be delivered faster and at a cheaper rate

Look up to develop more around SS state and give discounts for these state as its lowest customer base

People tend to order very less during early morning we can introduce some early morning discount to increase the usage

Pcs and musical instruments have less category but offer most revenue we can look to add up more categories for the same
